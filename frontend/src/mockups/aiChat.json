Let me break this down:\n\n## 📈 **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)**\n\n### ✅ **Pros:**\n- Reduces impact of volatility\n- Removes emotion from investing\n- *Perfect for beginners*\n- Builds discipline\n\n### ❌ **Cons:**\n- May miss out on gains in rising markets\n- Can be slower to reach full allocation\n\n## 💰 **Lump Sum Investing**\n\n### ✅ **Pros:**\n- Historically outperforms DCA ~66% of the time\n- *\"Time in market beats timing the market\"*\n- Immediate full exposure\n\n### ❌ **Cons:**\n- Higher risk if market drops immediately\n- Can be emotionally challenging\n\n## 🎯 **My Recommendation for You**\n\nGiven current market conditions, I suggest a **hybrid approach**:\n\n```\n📅 Investment Schedule:\nWeek 1: Invest 50% immediately\nWeeks 2-7: Invest remaining 50% over 6 weeks (8.33% each week)\n```\n\nThis gives you the benefit of immediate exposure while reducing timing risk. **What's your comfort level with this approach?**",
